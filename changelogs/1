This is the first changelog, so there is no important things to say.
I just want to thank you for using shapeshift zsh prompt! =)

PS: If you are using antigen with cache, maybe you will have noticed a terrible alert by antigen.
Don't worry, this wont bother you anymore! Just run this command and everything will be ok!

# rm -rf ~/.zcompdump && antigen reset
